Yesterday, I visited Sirs Crystal and Luis. Sir Dale said: "at most one of Sir Crystal, Sir Luis, Sir Dale, Sir Hugh and Sir Eduardo is a Knave." Then I met Sir Crystal who introduced me to his friend and told me: "I am a Knight." Then I met Sir Catherine who introduced me to his friend and told me: "all of us are Knaves." I asked Sir Florence who he was, and he answered impatiently: "at most one of Sir Crystal, Sir Luis, Sir Dale, Sir Hugh, Sir Eduardo, Sir Norma, Sir Callum, Sir Perry, Sir Garcia, Sir Catherine, Sir Isaac, Sir Clifford and Sir Florence is a Knave." Then I met Sir Tremblay who introduced me to his friend and told me: "Sir Luis is a Knight!"
