I have just seen Sirs Nora and Harvey. Then I met Sir Nora who introduced me to his friend and told me: "I am a Knight." Then I met Sir Fernando who introduced me to his friend and told me: "at most one of us is a Knave." "I am a Knave," whispered Sir Herbert. Then I met Sir Davies who introduced me to his friend and told me: "at most one of Sir Nora, Sir Harvey, Sir Davies, Sir Brittany, Sir Fernando, Sir Tina, Sir Herbert, Sir Beverly, Sir Teresa, Sir Dave, Sir Alexander and Sir Leona is a Knave." "At least one of us is a Knight," whispered Sir Nora.
