Yesterday, I visited Sirs Pamela, Dave and Ethan! I asked Sir Gail who he was, and he answered impatiently: "I am a Knave." Sir Dave said: "Sir Stephanie is a Knave!" I asked Sir Ellen who he was, and he answered impatiently: "at least one of Sir Pamela, Sir Dave, Sir Ethan, Sir Gail, Sir Anne, Sir Sophia, Sir Alma, Sir Stephanie and Sir Ellen is a Knight!" Sir Brent said: "at least one of Sir Pamela, Sir Dave, Sir Ethan, Sir Gail, Sir Anne, Sir Sophia, Sir Alma, Sir Stephanie, Sir Ellen, Sir Brent, Sir Liam and Sir Jake is a Knight!"
