I have just seen Sirs Matthew, Donna and Annie. Sir Matthew said: "exactly one of us is a Knight." I asked Sir Shannon who he was, and he answered impatiently: "Sir Matthew, Sir Donna, Sir Annie, Sir Holly and Sir Shannon are Knights." I asked Sir Ross who he was, and he answered impatiently: "at most one of Sir Matthew, Sir Donna, Sir Annie, Sir Holly, Sir Shannon, Sir Megan, Sir Ross, Sir Russell and Sir Deanna is a Knight." I asked Sir Megan who he was, and he answered impatiently: "exactly one of us is a Knave."
