I have just seen Sirs Ray, Micheal and Lonnie. I asked Sir Micheal who he was, and he answered impatiently: "Sir Brown is a Knave!" Sir Ray said: "Sir Beatrice is a Knave!" Sir Patrick said: "Sir Ray, Sir Micheal, Sir Lonnie, Sir Sarah, Sir Beatrice, Sir Brown and Sir Patrick are Knaves." Then I met Sir Ray who introduced me to his friend and told me: "Sir Ray, Sir Micheal, Sir Lonnie, Sir Sarah, Sir Beatrice, Sir Brown, Sir Patrick, Sir Darrell and Sir Ernest are Knights." I asked Sir Sarah who he was, and he answered impatiently: "at least one of Sir Ray, Sir Micheal, Sir Lonnie, Sir Sarah, Sir Beatrice, Sir Brown, Sir Patrick, Sir Darrell, Sir Ernest and Sir Vicki is a Knave!"
