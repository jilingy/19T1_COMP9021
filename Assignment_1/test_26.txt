I have just seen Sirs Alexander and Robin! Sir Robin said: "exactly one of us is a Knave." Then I met Sir Judith who introduced me to his friend and told me: "I am a Knight." "Exactly one of Sir Alexander, Sir Robin, Sir Priscilla, Sir Eleanor, Sir Morton, Sir Judith, Sir Frances, Sir Kirk, Sir Miguel, Sir Bruce and Sir Christine is a Knight," whispered Sir Kirk.
