Yesterday, I visited Sirs Olivia, Beverly and Williams! "At most one of us is a Knight," whispered Sir Olivia. "All of us are Knights," whispered Sir Olivia. Sir Mitchell said: "Sir Olivia, Sir Beverly, Sir Williams, Sir Fernando, Sir Natalie and Sir Mitchell are Knaves." Sir Peter said: "at least one of Sir Olivia, Sir Beverly, Sir Williams, Sir Fernando, Sir Natalie, Sir Mitchell, Sir Linda and Sir Peter is a Knight!" Then I met Sir Frances who introduced me to his friend and told me: "at least one of us is a Knave!"
