I have just seen Sirs Samantha and Erin. Sir Erin said: "Sir Samantha and Sir Erin are Knaves." Sir Nicholas said: "I am a Knave." Sir Terrance said: "Sir Samantha, Sir Erin, Sir Nicholas, Sir Charles, Sir Terrance or Sir Wendy is a Knight." Sir Erin said: "Sir Samantha, Sir Erin, Sir Nicholas, Sir Charles, Sir Terrance, Sir Wendy, Sir Diana, Sir Anna and Sir Herbert are Knaves." I asked Sir Nicholas who he was, and he answered impatiently: "all of us are Knights." Sir Wendy said: "Sir Samantha, Sir Erin, Sir Nicholas, Sir Charles, Sir Terrance, Sir Wendy, Sir Diana, Sir Anna, Sir Herbert, Sir Hugh, Sir Chris, Sir White or Sir Jamie is a Knave."
