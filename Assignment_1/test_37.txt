I have just seen Sirs Katie, Clarence, Connor and Tremblay. "I am a Knave," whispered Sir Tremblay. "Sir Katie, Sir Clarence, Sir Connor, Sir Tremblay, Sir Esther or Sir Judy is a Knave," whispered Sir Katie. "I am a Knave," whispered Sir Mattie. Sir Connor said: "Sir Katie, Sir Clarence, Sir Connor, Sir Tremblay, Sir Esther, Sir Judy, Sir Mattie, Sir Vernon, Sir Rita, Sir Alice and Sir Danielle are Knaves."
