I have just seen Sirs Ruby and Julia! "I am a Knight," whispered Sir Ruby. "I am a Knight," whispered Sir Hugh. Then I met Sir Elaine who introduced me to his friend and told me: "Sir Ruby, Sir Julia, Sir Miller, Sir Erika, Sir Hugh, Sir Darlene, Sir Liam and Sir Elaine are Knights." "Sir Ruby, Sir Julia, Sir Miller, Sir Erika, Sir Hugh, Sir Darlene, Sir Liam, Sir Elaine, Sir Ray and Sir Naomi are Knights," whispered Sir Naomi. I asked Sir Nathaniel who he was, and he answered impatiently: "Sir Ruby, Sir Julia, Sir Miller, Sir Erika, Sir Hugh, Sir Darlene, Sir Liam, Sir Elaine, Sir Ray, Sir Naomi, Sir Nathaniel or Sir Rodney is a Knave."
