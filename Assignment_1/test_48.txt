I have just met Sir Kathy. Then I met Sir Jamie who introduced me to his friend and told me: "Sir Kathy or Sir Jamie is a Knave." Sir Chester said: "exactly one of Sir Kathy, Sir Jamie and Sir Chester is a Knight." Then I met Sir Lawrence who introduced me to his friend and told me: "at most one of Sir Kathy, Sir Jamie, Sir Chester and Sir Lawrence is a Knight." "All of us are Knaves," whispered Sir Ken. Then I met Sir Maria who introduced me to his friend and told me: "Sir Kathy, Sir Jamie, Sir Chester, Sir Lawrence, Sir Murphy, Sir Ken, Sir Charlie, Sir Christy and Sir Maria are Knaves." Sir Christy said: "at least one of Sir Kathy, Sir Jamie, Sir Chester, Sir Lawrence, Sir Murphy, Sir Ken, Sir Charlie, Sir Christy, Sir Maria and Sir Nathaniel is a Knave!"
